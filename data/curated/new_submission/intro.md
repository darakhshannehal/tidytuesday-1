This week we are exploring type 2 diabetes data from the Pima Indian community near Phoenix, Arizona. The study includes only women aged 21 and older, all of Pima heritage, with at least five years of follow-up. Each participant underwent regular oral glucose tolerance tests, and diabetes was diagnosed using WHO criteria.

> People with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) become less sensitive to insulin. After a glucose load, both blood glucose and insulin levels rise, but glucose does not fall as quickly as it shouldâ€”leading to sustained elevations. The incidence of type 2 DM is rising in many Western cultures, as increasingly unhealthy and calorie-rich diets become common.

-   What is the distribution of the glucose-to-insulin ratio, and how does it differ by diabetes outcome?
-   Can we build a logistic regression model to predict `diabetes_5y` using glucose, BMI, and pedigree?
-   How does the number of pregnancies relate to diabetes risk in this cohort?
-   How does BMI vary across age groups, and is it associated with diabetes diagnosis?
